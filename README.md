# messing-with-Js

In this repository I use what I know about JavaScript to create some little codes and projects in the best way I can

- In the **/Math.random()**, I stored every code focused on the function Math.random();
- In the **/Data validation**, I stored every code focused on validating the data the user provide to the code;
- In thr **/Arrays**, I stores every code focused on manipulating arrays;
