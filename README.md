# messing-with-Js

In this repository I use what I know about JavaScript to create some little codes and projects in the best way I can

- In **/Math.random()**, I stored every code focused on the function Math.random();
- In **/Data validation**, I stored every code focused on validating the data the user provide to the code;
- In **/Arrays**, I stored every code focused on manipulating and checking arrays;
